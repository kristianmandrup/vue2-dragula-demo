# Dragula for Vue2 via vue-dragula

> A Vue.js demo app which demonstrates how to use [Dragula](https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) with [Vue 2](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for drag and drop. Includes Time Travel demo (undo/redo) in *Named service* example.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## TODO
- transitions

### Transitions
We would very much like to add support for Vue [transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html) and [transition groups](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#List-Move-Transitions) as per discussions in this [issue](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/vue2-dragula/issues/7)

Here is a [jsFiddle Demo: single list with transitions](https://jsfiddle.net/av1jLfn8/)

- [Vue reactivity in depth](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html)

We might need to use `Vue.set` to explicitly notify Vue that the underlying array has changed and thus activate the transition effect or change the way we update the Array in `ModelManager`. Please experiment!

### Development
To help improve the plugin, please do the following:
- fork [vue2-dragula](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/vue2-dragula) and clone it to local disk
- from within the root of `/vue2-dragula` run `npm link` to make a symbolic global link to this package
- from the root of this demo app, run `npm link vue2-dragula` to install the `vue2-dragula` module via the symbolic link

When you make changes to the plugin, make sure you run `npm run build` in order to compile it to `/dist`.

You can also set up a watcher to auto-build on every change.

## Design
*components*

- `Home` brief overview of the examples
- `GlobalService` use of global app service
- `NamedServices` named services with `copy: true`
- `DragEffects` drag effects on a named service
- `CustomModelManager` immutable model manager with time travel

*router*

The app is configured with a router which have the following components mounted:
- `/` : `home`
- `/global` : `global`
- `/named` : `named`
- `/effects` : `effects`

*To add your own example page*

Add a route in `routes/index` and your example component in `/components`.
Register the component in `/components/index.js` and update the main navigation in `App.vue` with a
link to your example route.

### Bugs and issues
Please report [bugs or issues](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/vue2-dragula)

## Using v-dragula directive
- `v-dragula` directive on an element must point to an underlying data model (`Array`) in the VM.
- `service` attribute specifies a registered `DragulaService`
- `drake` attribute to use a specific named drake configuration registered on the service

### Global app service example
If you don't specify a service the global application level dragula service `$dragula.$service` will be used

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colOne" drake="first">
    <div v-for="text in colOne" :key="text" @click="onClick">{{text}} [click me]</div>
  </div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colTwo" drake="first">
    <div v-for="text in colTwo" :key="text">{{text}}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Named services
DOM element containers can be configured to use specific named services:

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colOne" service="first" drake="a">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colTwp" service="first" drake="b">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colTwo" service="first" drake="b">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="stocks" service="second" drake="a">...</div>
</div>
```

Every service has a `default` drake with default a dragula configuration.
You can use the `default` drake by not setting the `drake` attribute.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colOne" service="first">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colTwp" service="first">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="colTwo" service="first" drake="b">...</div>
  <div class="container" v-dragula="stocks" service="second">...</div>
</div>
```

### Custom Model Manager with Time Travel
Time travel uses the following classes
- `ImmutableModelManager`
- `TimeMachine`
- `ActionManager`

`ImmutableModelManager` uses [seamless-immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seamless-immutable) which contains Immutable data structures for JavaScript which are backwards-compatible with normal JS Arrays and Objects.

Implements basic Time Travel with undo/redo back and forward in model history.
Play with it and have fun!

The difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate the collection, like `push`, `set`, `unshift` or `splice` instead return a new immutable collection.
Methods which return new arrays like `slice` or `concat` also return new immutable collections.

The local VM should maintain a history of transactions that can be undone.

An action consists of:
- `dragIndex` index in source model
- `dropIndex` index in target model
- `sourceModel` source list (or model manager that manages a list, ie. a model)
- `targetModel` destination list
- `transitModel` item (or list) in transition from source to target

These params are also grouped for the `insertAt` event:

```js
models: {
  source,
  target,
  transit
},
indexes: {
  drag,
  drop
},
elements: {
  source, // container
  target, // container
  drop // element being dropped/inserted
}
```

The event handlers `insertAt` and `dropModel` can be used to manage the action history.
`insertAt` is the best candidate, as it has access to all the action information.

```js
'effects:insertAt': ({indexes, models, elements}) => {

},

'effects:dropModel': ({name, el, source, target, dragIndex, dropIndex, sourceModel}) => {
}
```

The `ImmModelManager` contains all the history methods/tracking but we need to use this in the VM itself.
Both the `sourceModel` and `targetModel` have a history, so we can undo both and update the VM models to reflect it.
The VM/drake model references are encapsulated by the `ImmModelManager` as `modelRef` for both `source` and `target` models.

`ImmModelManager` uses a `TimeMachine` to manage history and handle time transitions.
The key method is `timeTravel` method shown here, which sets the `modelRef` via `updateModelRef()`.
`timeTravel` is used internally by both `undo` and `redo`. Note that `updateModelRef` is also called internally by
`insertAt` and `removeAt` to ensure `modelRef` is always in sync.

```js
  timeTravel (index) {
    this.log('timeTravel to', index)
    this.model = this.history[index]
    this.updateModelRef()
    return this
  }
```

The `actionManager` can be used to manage the done and undone actions on the containers (and models) of the VM.

```js
  created () {
    // ...

    this.actionManager = new actionManager({
      logging: true
    })
    // ...
  }
```

You can add an `onUndo` and `onRedo` handler as follows:

```js
this.actionManager.onUndo((action) => {
  let { models, indexes, elements } = action
  log('onUndo', action, models, indexes, elements)
  // ...
})
```

In the example we hook the `actionManager` to some VM methods

```js
  methods: {
    undo () {
      this.actionManager.undo()
    },
    redo () {
      this.actionManager.redo()
    },
    act (action) {
      this.actionManager.act(action)
    }
  },
```

The `insertAt` event handler performs a given action via the VM `act` method.

```js
  'effects:insertAt': ({indexes, models, elements}) => {
    this.act({
      name,
      models,
      indexes
    })

  },
```

The template includes buttons to trigger `undo` and `redo` of those actions via the `actionManager`.

```html
  <div class="actions">
    <button @click="undo">undo</button>
    <button @click="redo">redo</button>
    <button @click="setRandom">generate</button>
  </div>
```

*Notice*

If you check the log, you will see that for `TimeMachine [...] set modelRef` it sets the VM model containers back to their original on `undo` but the UI doesn't reflect this (Array pointer) update.
What to do to make the UI respond to this change!?

`v-for="text in colOne"` needs to be forced to re-iterate somehow, see [Vue2 list rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html).
and see [sorting](http://arrayy.com/make-vuejs-vfor-directive-sortable.html)

"To work around this problem we need to add a unique identifier to our array items, and then bind this identifier to key property in our HTML."

Vue wraps an observed arrayâ€™s mutation methods so they will also trigger view updates.

Vue implements some smart heuristics to maximize DOM element reuse, so replacing an array with another array containing overlapping objects is a very efficient operation.

See also [list caveats](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Caveats)

```js
  timeTravel (index) {
    this.log('timeTravel to', index)
    this.model = this.history[index]

    // this.modelRef = mutable
    // this.log('set modelRef', this.modelRef, this.model)
    this.modelRef.splice(0, this.modelRef.length)
    for (let item of this.model) {
      this.modelRef.push(item)
    }

    return this
  }
```

Let us know if you know/find a better, simpler or more efficient way to correctly trigger Vue2 to notice that the Array has been updated and update the VDOM + re-iterate the `v-for` in the template/view.

You can experiment in `setRandom` of the VM which uses the same strategy.

### Dragula Service pre-configuration
*Important* Always pre-configure named services with drakes in the `created` life cycle hook method of the VM.

```js
created () {
  let myService = this.$dragula.createService({
    name: 'my-service',
    drakes: {
      first: {
        copy: true,
      }
    }
  })

  let otherService = this.$dragula.createService({
    name: 'other-service',
    drake: {
      // default drake config
    }
  })

  myService.on({
    drop: (el, container) => {
      console.log('drop: ', el, container)
    }
    ...
  })
}
```

### Styling

*Add handles*

```js
.handle {
    padding: 0 5px;
    margin-right: 5px;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
    cursor: move;
}
```

Add a black border effect on `:hover` over draggable child elements of a `drake` container

```js
[drake] >:hover {
  border: 2px solid black
}
```

### UX effects via event handlers
Add/Remove DOM element style classes as UX effects for drag'n drop events.
Here using [classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

```js
service.on({
  accepts: (drake, el, target) => {
    log('accepts: ', el, target)
    return true // target !== document.getElementById(left)
  },
  drag: (drake, el, container) => {
    log('drag: ', 'el:', el, 'c:', container)
    log('classList', el.classList)
    el.classList.remove('ex-moved')
  },
  drop: (drake, el, container) => {
    log('drop: ', el, container)
    log('classList', el.classList)
    el.classList.add('ex-moved')
  },
  over: (drake, el, container) => {
    log('over: ', el, container)
    log('classList', el.classList)
    el.classList.add('ex-over')
  },
  out: (drake, el, container) => {
    log('out: ', el, container)
    log('classList', el.classList)
    el.classList.remove('ex-over')
  }
})
```

Sample effects styling

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.ex-moved {
  animation: fadeIn .5s ease-in 1 forwards;
  border: 2px solid yellow;
  padding: 2px
}

.ex-over {
  animation: fadeIn .5s ease-in 1 forwards;
  border: 4px solid green;
  padding: 2px
}
```

Note that `assets/styles.css` contains most of the styling used, primarily this part of interest:

```css
.container .ex-moved {
  background-color: #e74c3c;
}
.container.ex-over {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
}
.handle {
  padding: 0 5px;
  margin-right: 5px;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  cursor: move;
}
```

Tip: Please add more examples showcasing dynamic styling and transition effects to better visualize the drag and drop actions/events ;)

### Configuring dragula options
Dragula includes loads of options you can use to fine tune the Dnd behaviour.

```js
dragula(containers, {
  isContainer: function (el) {
    return false; // only elements in drake.containers will be taken into account
  },
  moves: function (el, source, handle, sibling) {
    return true; // elements are always draggable by default
  },
  accepts: function (el, target, source, sibling) {
    return true; // elements can be dropped in any of the `containers` by default
  },
  invalid: function (el, handle) {
    return false; // don't prevent any drags from initiating by default
  },
  direction: 'vertical',             // Y axis is considered when determining where an element would be dropped
  copy: false,                       // elements are moved by default, not copied
  copySortSource: false,             // elements in copy-source containers can be reordered
  revertOnSpill: false,              // spilling will put the element back where it was dragged from, if this is true
  removeOnSpill: false,              // spilling will `.remove` the element, if this is true
  mirrorContainer: document.body,    // set the element that gets mirror elements appended
  ignoreInputTextSelection: true     // allows users to select input text, see details below
});
```

Let us know if this demo helps you and what you build with this example as your foundation.

Feel free to improve it or come with suggestions for new features etc :)

**Enjoy!!!**
